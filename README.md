# End-to-End-Sales-Analytics-Tableau-SQL

## Project Objective

End-to-end sales analytics project using MS SQL Server for data cleaning, transformation, and validation, paired with an interactive Tableau dashboard. Tracks key sales metrics and trends to enable data-driven decisions. Ideal for analysts seeking a complete SQL-to-Tableau analytics workflow.

## Process

⚙️ **Process Overview**

🔹 **Step 1: Data Cleaning & Validation (SQL)**
- Checked for missing values, duplicates, and anomalies.
- Standardized data types, date formats, and categorical values.
- Ensured consistency across tables (e.g., product IDs, customer IDs, region codes).

🔹 **Step 2: Data Transformation (SQL)**
- Used joins, aggregations, and case statements to prepare datasets.
- Created calculated fields (e.g., profit margin, sales growth).
- Structured data into fact and dimension tables for efficient analysis.

🔹 **Step 3: Data Aggregation (SQL)**
- Wrote queries to extract KPIs such as Total Sales, AOV, Customer Metrics, and Profitability.
- Built summary tables that served as the foundation for visualization.

🔹 **Step 4: Data Visualization (Tableau)**
- Connected Tableau directly to the SQL database.
- Designed an interactive dashboard with:
  - KPI cards (Revenue, AOV, Growth, etc.)
  - Trend analysis (sales over time)
  - Category, region, and channel performance charts
  - Filters and slicers for deeper exploration
- Published the dashboard for stakeholders to explore insights dynamically.

## 📊 Project Insights
The dashboard provides a **comprehensive view of sales performance** across weeks, product categories, courier status, sales channels, product sizes, and top-performing states.  

With **dynamic filters and slicers** in Tableau, users can drill down into specific time periods, categories, or regions for more focused analysis.  

Key insights include:  
- 🔹 Identification of **top-selling products** and **high-value customers**.  
- 🔹 Analysis of **state-wise and regional performance** to highlight strong and weak markets.  
- 🔹 Evaluation of **sales channels** to determine which platforms drive the most revenue.  
- 🔹 Monitoring of **cancellations and courier performance** for operational improvements.  
- 🔹 Tracking of **Sales vs Targets**, helping measure goal achievement.  

This project demonstrates how **SQL-powered data processing** combined with **Tableau dashboards** can deliver **clear, actionable, and interactive business insights**.
